# xfair-splash
This is the xFair Splash Page.

Since this Github pages, the public-facing branch is `gh-pages`. Therefore, `gh-pages` is a sacred branch, do not commit there unless you are 100% certain it is deploy-ready.


Testing
-------

To view the splash page on your own computer, simply run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (if using python3, run `python -m http.server`) in this directory. Then, go to `http://localhost:8000` to view your version.

Dev
---

Make sure to compile your scss appropriately. Something like `sass --watch stylesheets/scss:stylesheets` suffices.
